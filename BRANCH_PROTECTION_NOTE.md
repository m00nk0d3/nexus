# Branch Protection Status

## ✅ BRANCH PROTECTION ACTIVE

The GitHub repository `m00nk0d3/nexus` is now **public** with **branch protection fully configured**.

### Active Configuration
```
✅ Repository visibility: Public
✅ Branch protection: Enabled on main
✅ PR requirement: 1 approval (can be self-review)
✅ Status checks: copilot-setup-steps must pass
✅ Stale reviews: Auto-dismissed on new commits
✅ Auto-merge: Enabled
✅ Delete on merge: Enabled
✅ Up-to-date requirement: Enabled
```

## Recommended Options (If Reverting to Private)

If you change back to private, you would need GitHub Pro. Options at that time:
- Upgrade to GitHub Pro ($4/month) - Full branch protection on private repos
- Keep public - Free branch protection continues

## Branch Protection Rules (When Available)

When GitHub Pro is enabled, configure these settings:

```
Repository Settings → Branches → Add rule for "main"

Required settings:
✓ Require a pull request before merging
  ├─ Required number of approvals: 1 (solo dev can self-review)
  ├─ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits pushed
  └─ Require review from code owners (optional)

✓ Require status checks to pass before merging
  └─ Status checks required: copilot-setup-steps

✓ Include administrators
  └─ Allow force pushes: No
  └─ Allow deletions: No

✓ Automatically delete branch on merge
✓ Require branches to be up to date before merging
```

## Current Workflow

Until branch protection is enabled, the development workflow is documented in `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`:

1. ✅ Feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/issue-XX`
2. ✅ TDD cycle: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
3. ✅ Status check: Push to feature branch
4. ✅ PR review: Self-review in GitHub PR
5. ✅ Merge: When ready

**The Copilot setup workflow must pass before merging to main** (manual enforcement via PR review).

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use PR workflow from CONTRIBUTING.md (documentation-based enforcement)
2. **Soon**: Decide between Pro upgrade or public repo
3. **Later**: Configure branch protection rules in GitHub web UI
